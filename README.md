This is a repository of a little side project for work and university.
Although I'd like to work with C# and .NET or Java I've found it enabling to
learn other languages and frameworks.

This Rails project is to serve a better understanding of the MVC pattern and with the 
same instance it's a small application to help day-to-day operation at my current work.
